![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107015203/176031635-c1016f71-69a1-492e-8ca0-4945d25d13a4.png)
## A KSP mod that adds the EcoRocket by Romanian aerospace company ARCAspace

### This mod includes basic parts needed to create the EcoRocket by ARCAspace.

Included are: 

- First and Second Stage "Heated Water" tanks
- First and Second Stage Toroidal Aerospike Engines
- Landing Engine
- The upper stage Kerosene and High Test Peroxide tank and its engine
- A custom fairing
- Custom fins

The mod is fully to scale with the real EcoRocket, so it may be a bit overpowered for the Stock system size, so ReScale is recommended. Furthermore, since it is to scale with real life, it *should* be able to reach orbit in Real Solar System, or any real life ReScale configs, however, do not blame me if you cannot reach orbit with it, ARCA designed this, I merely went off their numbers! 

(I personally have used this rocket with a 2.5x ReScale Config, and it is quite fun to use, but still wildly overpowered).

### Features

- Interchangeable tank decals for the first and second stages. The flags and logos are 'Kerbalified', so if you want a more realistic looking EcoRocket, you may use Conformal Decals or another mod to replace these decals!
- Realistic Steam Plumes!
- Custom fuels (you may use these in your own mods if you wish)
- Not reaching Orbit (this mod is very realistic).

### Known Issues

There are quite a few problems with this mod. None affect gameplay, and none are actual bugs (I squashed all of those), however, there are a lot of things I intend to fix.

This is my first ever KSP mod, and I have been learning as I go, so forgive me if there are some things you may find lacking. 

These include, and are not limited to:

- Inefficient or really high poly meshes
- Lackluster texturing
- Boring meshes
- Glowing thumbnails?
- Missing Ambient Occlusion on a lot of parts

I do intend to fix all of this in later updates, I am just a bit burnt out right now and will revist it in a few days. 

## Dependancies and Recommendations

This mod doesn't depend on too many other mods, however, it does require some for the best experience.

- Dependancies

  - [Waterfall](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/196309-112x-waterfall-a-framework-for-continuous-mesh-driven-engine-effects-jan-17/) for the engine FX. You technically do not need this, however, if you do not have it, the engines will not have any plume (not even the stock ones).

- Recommended

  - [ReScale](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/195569-181-191-rescale-continued-v100/) to help with balancing the rocket and making it more or less overpowered. 

  - [Conformal Decals](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/194802-18-112-conformal-decals-0210-decals-done-the-right-way-now-on-ckan/) for custom flags and customisation of the rocket.

## Roadmap for future updates

### Update 1
- Fix a majority of texture and mesh issues, as well as the glowing thumbnail problem

### Update 2
- Update the meshes for:
  - First stage tank
  - First and Second stage fins
  - Third stage Engine
  - Fairing
 
### Update 3 
- Add more part variants, such as theoretical upgraded engines, longer tanks, larger fairings, and more. 

If you have any suggestions, bugs to report, or help to offer, then I am all ears. You can contact me using the contacts on my profile.
